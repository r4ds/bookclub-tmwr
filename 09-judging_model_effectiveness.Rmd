# Judging model effectiveness

**Learning objectives:**

- Explain why **measures of model fit** to actual data **are important** even for purely inferential models.
- Use `{yardstick}` to compute regression metrics.
  - Recognize `{yardstick}` function output.
  - Create a metric set with `yardstick::metric_set()`.
- Use `{yardstick}` to compute binary classification metrics.
  - Describe the common arguments for `{yardstick}` classification metrics.
  - Visualize a binary classification model fit using `{yardstick}` and `{ggplot2}`.
- Use `{yardstick}` to compute multi-class classification metrics.
  - Extend an explicitly binary metric such as `sensitivity()` to multiple classes using `{yardstick}`.
- Combine `{yardstick}` metrics with `dplyr::group_by()`.
  - Visualize a model fit for different groups using `{yardstick}`, `{dplyr}`, and `{ggplot2}`
