# R4DS Tidy Modeling with R Book Club

Welcome to the R4DS Tidy Modeling with R Book Club!

We are working together to read [Tidy Modeling with R](https://www.tmwr.org/) by Max Kuhn and Julia Silge.
Join the #book_club-tidy_modeling_with_r channel on the [R4DS Slack](https://r4ds.io/join) to participate.
As we read, we are producing [notes about the book](https://r4ds.github.io/bookclub-tmwr/).
