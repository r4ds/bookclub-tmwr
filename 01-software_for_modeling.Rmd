# Software for modeling

**Learning objectives:**

- **Recognize the principles** around which the `{tidymodels}` packages were designed.
- Classify models as **descriptive, inferential,** and/or **predictive.**
- Define **descriptive model.**
- Define **inferential model.**
- Define **predictive model.**
- Differentiate between **supervised** and **unsupervised** models.
- Differentiate between **regression** and **classification** models.
- Differentiate between **quantitative** and **qualitative** data.
- Understand the **roles that data can have** in an analysis.
- Apply the **data science process.**
- Recognize the **phases of modeling.**

>The utility of a model hinges on its ability to be *reductive*. The primary influences in the data can be captured mathematically in a useful way, such as in a relationship that can be expressed as an equation.

## The pit of success

`{tidymodels}` aims to help us fall into the Pit of Success:

> The Pit of Success: in stark contrast to a summit, a peak, or a journey across a desert to find victory through many trials and surprises, we want our customers to simply fall into winning practices by using our platform and frameworks.

- **Avoid confusion:** Software should facilitate proper usage.
- **Avoid mistakes:** Software should make it easy for users to do the right thing.

## Types of models

- **Descriptive models:** Describe or illustrate characteristics of data.
- **Inferential models:** Make some statement of truth regarding a predefined conjecture or idea.
  - Inferential techniques typically produce some type of probabilistic output, such as a p-value, confidence interval, or posterior probability.
  - Usually delayed feedback between inference and actual result.
- **Predictive models:** Produce the most accurate possible prediction for new data. *Estimation* ("How much?") rather than *inference* ("Will it?").
  - **Mechanistic models** are derived using first principles to produce a model equation that is dependent on assumptions.
    - Depend on the assumptions that define their model equations.
    - Unlike inferential models, it is easy to make data-driven statements about how well the model performs based on how well it predicts the existing data
  - **Empirically driven models** have more vague assumptions, and are derived directly from the data.
    - No theoretical or probabilistic assumptions are made about the equations or the variables
    - The primary method of evaluating the appropriateness of the model is to assess its accuracy using existing data

## Terminology

- **Unsupervised models** are used to understand relationships between variables or sets of variables without an explicit relationship between variables and an outcome.
  - Examples: PCA, clustering, autoencoders.
- **Supervised models** have an outcome variable.
  - Examples: linear regression, neural networks.
  - **Regression:** numeric outcome
  - **Classification:** ordered or unordered qualitative values.
- **Quantitative** data: numbers.
- **Qualitative** (nominal) data: non-numbers.
- Data can have different roles in analyses:
  - **Outcomes** (labels, endpoints, dependent variables): the value being predicted in supervised models.
  - **Predictors** (independent variables): the variables used to predict the outcome.

## The data analysis process

1. Cleaning the data: investigate the data to make sure that they are applicable to the project goals, accurate, and appropriate
2. Understanding the data: often referred to as exploratory data analysis (EDA). EDA brings to light how the different variables are related to one another, their distributions, typical ranges, and other attributes. 
    - “How did I come by *these* data?”
    - "Is the data *relevant*?"
3. Develop clear expectations of the goal of your model and how performance will be judged ([Chapter 9](https://www.tmwr.org/performance.html))
    - "What is/are the *performance metrics or realistic goal/s* of what can be achieved?"

</div>

- **Exploratory data analysis:** Explore the data to see what they might tell you. (See previous)
- **Feature engineering:** Create specific model terms that make it easier to accurately model the observed data. Covered in [Chapter 6](https://www.tmwr.org/recipes.html#recipes).
- **Model tuning and selection:** Generate a variety of models and compare performance.
  - Some models require **hyperparameter tuning**
- **Model evaluation:** Use EDA-like analyses and compare model performance metrics to choose the best model for your situation.
