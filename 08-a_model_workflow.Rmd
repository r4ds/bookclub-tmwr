# A model workflow

**Learning objectives:**

- Explain why a **model workflow** includes preprocessing, fitting, and post-processing.
  - Describe parts of the modeling process that **occur before the model is fit.**
  - Describe parts of the modeling process that **occur after the model is fit.**
- Use the `{workflows}` package to **create a simple workflow.**
  - **Add a model** to a workflow.
  - **Add a formula** to a workflow.
  - **Fit** a workflow.
  - Use a workflow to **predict new data.**
  - **Update** a workflow.
- Use `{recipes}` with `{workflows}`.
  - **Add a recipe** to a workflow.
  - Use `workflows::pull_*()` to **extract objects from fitted workflows.**
- Describe how a workflow that uses a formula decides how to pre-process data.
  - Describe how workflows **using tree-based models** pre-process factor predictors.
  - **Add a special formula** to a workflow with the `formula` argument to `workflows::add_model()`.
- Describe workflow steps that are **not yet included** in `{tidmodels}`.
