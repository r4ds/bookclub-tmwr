# Feature engineering with recipes

**Learning objectives:**

- Define **feature engineering.**
- List **reasons** that feature engineering might be **beneficial.**
- Use the {recipes} package to **create a simple feature engineering recipe.**
- Use selectors from the {recipes} package to **apply transformations to specific types of columns.**
- List some **advantages of using a recipe** for feature engineering.
- Describe **what happens when a recipe is prepared** with `recipes::prep()`.
- Use `recipes::bake()` to **process a dataset.**
- Recognize how to use `recipes::step_unknown()`, `recipes::step_novel()`, `recipes::step_other()` to **prepare factor variables.**
- Explain how `recipes::step_dummy()` **encodes qualitative data in a numeric format.**
- Recognize techniques for dealing with large numbers of categories, such as feature hashing or encoding using the {embed} package (as described in [this talk by Alan Feder at rstudio::global(2021)](https://rstudio.com/resources/rstudioglobal-2021/categorical-embeddings-new-ways-to-simplify-complex-data/)).
- Recognize methods for **encoding ordered factors.**


(Still working on LOs, all those are just through section 6.4!)
