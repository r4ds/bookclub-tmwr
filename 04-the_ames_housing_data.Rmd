- Explain when it makes sense to **log-transform data.**

## Pittsburgh: a parallel real world example

[Conor Tompkins](https://twitter.com/conor_tompkins) presented a fantastic overview of home sale price modelling by taking us through his recent project on Pittsburgh home sale price modelling, including discussions about his **exploratory data analysis**, motivations behind **log-transforming** sale data, and thoughts about **inflation-adjusting** historical sale prices.
